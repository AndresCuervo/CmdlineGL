	<h3>Preface</h3>
	<p>In CmdlineGL, I wanted some simple kind of font system that wouldn't be dependant on
	libraries installed on the system, and also not dependant on which SDL modules were
	installed.  So, I went and pulled an old idea (which I've probably seen somewhere)
	making use of control pixels in a bitmap to denote the size/spacing of font characters
	and wrote it up.
	<p>This font system allows you to &quot;make a font&quot; using a plain old bitmap editor,
	or even convert a font from trueType to bitmap by using the text-tool in those same editors
	and then marking the boundaries of the characters.  It expects the ascii characters from 0x20
	(space) up to 0x7F (DEL), 96 characters in total.  This is likely only usable by
	English-speaking folks, unfortunately.  I'd love to extend it to handle a variable number
	of characters, and read UTF8 unicode, but I didn't see any easy way to do this.
	Maybe people with more experience in this area would like to contribute.
	
	<h3>Using the commands</h3>
	<p>I added 2 &quot;GL-ish&quot; commands to work with fonts:
	cglNewFont, and cglText.
	<p>cglNewFont takes three parameters: the type of font, the symbolic name for it, and the file name.
	The type currently must be CGL_BMPFONT, the symbolic name can be any <a href="NamedObjects.html">valid name</a>,
	and the file name is any valid system-dependant file path.

	<p>cglText takes two parameters as well: the name of the font to use, and the text string to render with it.
	As of now, the rendering is very dumb, and only renders lines as they are given.
	I might, in a future version, start handling things like tabs and newlines, or even
	add some options for wrapping.
