	<h2>Introducing</h2>
 	<h1>OpenGL Bindings for BASH</h1>
	</center>
	<h2>"What???"</h2>
	<p>A while back, I came accross a game called <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org">Frozen Bubble</a>, which is a <a href="http://www.snood.com">Snood</a>
	clone written in Perl using the OpenGL bindings.  I was rather offended by the
	whole concept, and said something like "Arg! Thats almost as bad as writing a 3D
	game in Bash!".  So, this December during winter break, when I was trying to think
	of something to do for <i>TheSilverDirk's Abuse of Technology</i> #6....
	</p>
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><h2>"Oh, God!&nbsp;&nbsp;No!!"</h2></td><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;-- (common actual quote, not my profanity)</i></td></tr></table>
	<p>But here it is!  Bwa-Ha-Ha! All the normal languages have OpenGL support,
	and some scripting languages like Perl and Python and PHP have OpenGL bindings,
 	and now Bash does too!
	</p>
	<h2>"But how?  Bash doesn't support modules..."</h2>
	<p>Right.  So I gave it an interface just like all the others it uses:
	a simple command that can be given parameters and fed commands on standatd input.</p>
	When invoked, CmdlineGL starts a server which creates an OpenGL window, and then either
	reads input from a file or from standard-in.  To deliver commands to it, a script can
	pipe standard-out to the program, or write to a fifo, or other creative methods.
	The script sends lines of text to the server that tell it to execute any of the
	supported OpenGL, GLU, or GLUT API calls.  CmdlineGL supports textures, display lists,
	quadrics, and just about all of the usual gl calls.
	</p>
	<h2>"But isn't that an incredibly bad design?"</h2>
	<p>Yes! and thats what makes it so wrong.  (Recall: The Silver Dirk's Abuse of Technology)
	But, it might not be as slow as you think:
	CmdlineGL is written in straight C with as little overhead as possible.
	It also uses a statically defined hash table to interpret the names of the commands.
	And, in a 3D application, most of the time is spent drawing pixels and texturing them,
	and this is probably done by the graphics card,
	so there's plenty of CPU time left over for running data through a pipe and a socket,
	and running string-to-float conversions,
 	and repeatedly forking thousands of times per frame per second,
	Especially with the speed of today's computers ;-)
	</p>
	<h2>"And you actually wrote a game using this kluge?"</h2>
	<p>Well, that part was a bit more tricky, but yes.  Lets review some of the obstacles
	involved with a realtime game, and our old friend/nemesis Bash:
	<ul>
	<li><h4>Bash needs to receive key/mouse activity from the server.  There are no RPCs</h4>
		<p>The only natural way bash has to receive feedback from the user is a text stream.
		One other possibility is for it to call a special program which would contact the
		server, get some information, and give it back to bash in the form of a integer result
		code, but this seemed particularly slow.  So, I came up with the idea that the server
		could simply write user actions to stdout, and this could be piped to the stdin of the
		script.
		</p>
		<p>I formed this cyclic stream using a fifo:</p>
<div class="code">
$ mkfifo /tmp/CmdlineGL_fifo<br/>
$ Script.sh &lt; /tmp/CmdlineGL_fifo | CmdlineGL &gt; /tmp/CmdlineGL_fifo
</div>
		<p>And then the rest was simple:  script reads user input from stdin, script generates
		frame of output commands to stdout, script reads use input from stdin....
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>Bash does not support asynchronous IO</h4>
		<p>The next problem of course, was that if the user doesn't type anything, a call
 		to "read" will block.
		Read actually does have a timeout feature, but in granularity of seconds,
		and a timeout of 0 doesn't seem to work.  So, I just changed my design a little
		to ensure that there is always a line to read from stdin. Thus the existance of the
		"cglEcho" command.  At the beginning of the script, and after reading user input on
		each frame, I write "cglEcho&nbsp;_____".  CmdlineGL sees the echo command, and echoes
		the argument back to me.  Then, next time I read through stdin I stop after seeing
		"_____" because it means I've processed a whole frame's worth of user input.
		</p>
		<p>The cglEcho command actually became obsolete, with the arrival of cglGetTime, as you
		will see in my next point.  I left cglEcho as it was, though.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>Keeping pace with the processor</h4>
		<p>One of the more classic video game problems is making sure that the game runs the
		same speed on all machines.  When playing a video, you need to keep the frame rate
		steady, and when running a game engine you need to make sure that the framerate
		doesn't affect the speed of the gameplay.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>Math.. or lack thereof</h4>
		<p>So, one of the first major obstacles I hit when porting my walking robot demo from C
		to bash was the lack of floating point support.
		It seemed obvious that calling bc for all my math operations would be a bit slow.
		At first, I tried writing functions that would string-manipulate a floating point number
		to fixed point, perform the calculation, and then string-manipulate back.  This involved
		a lot of back-quote substitutions, and was slow.  So, I needed a way to use integers.
		Why not just use glScale?  Well, mainly because that won't scale the angles of the
		glRotate command, and the robot was looking a little jerky with whole degree rotations.
		</p>
		<p>So... against my instincts for good design, I added a 'feature' to CmdlineGl that
		causes it to look for fixed-point numbers any place it would normally expect floating point.
		Implementing this was rather simple, though: I made a "cglFixedPt <x>" function that
		takes a parameter X, calculates 1/X, and multiplies all future floating point numbers
		by this amount.  The fact that the script is sending integers is then irrelevant.
		</p>
		<p>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>"So, what can I do to... 'Repay' you for this?"</h2>
	<p>If you were thinking along the lines of thanks: bug fixes, implementing more of
	the OpenGL commands, bug reports, money, pizza coupons, sending Morrowgrain to Zellin
	on Earthen Ring (if you don't know what that means, don't worry about it), etc.
	</p>
	<p>If you were thinking more along the lines of revenge, you could try using CmdlineGL
 	to write a multiplayer racing game (like a Mario Cart clone or something) in Prolog.
	</p>
	<h2>"Where's the Windows version?"</h2>
	<p>The Windows version is the same as the Linux version.
	You'll just need to edit the source code a little before you can run it.  ;-)
	</p>
	<p>At the moment, the unix-specific things in this code are the asynchronous IO,
	the fifo's, and the timing.  If you replace all the 'open' and 'read' with CreateFile and
	ReadFile, comment out the fifo stuff, and replace gettimeofday and usleep with GetCurrentTime
	and Sleep (remember that it'll change microseconds to milliseconds), it just might work on
	Windows.  Then all you need is bash, which can be gotten from Cygwin.  You will still need
	some way of creating the stdin/stdout loop between the script and CmdlineGL, and I'm not
	going to even investigate that.
	</p>
	<p>I really can't see any reason why you'd want to do this on Windows (unless
	perhaps your graphics card isn't accelerated under X).  Anyway, it's your time.
	(and if you get a windows version working, I'll gladly host it)
