	New design:

		Server.c
			Everything to do with setting up the window and watching file descriptors.

		ProcessInput.c
			Everything to do with reading input from a file descriptor, and sending it to the ParseGL
			module for execution.

		ParseGL.c
			Everything to do with taking a parsed line of text, and determining whether it can be
			executed, and executing it.

		SymbolHash.c
			All the hash table stuff.
